   * The function source_term_blend_in is mainly used to blend in the source

   * placed at the boundary of the CFD domain, there can be problems when
   * interpolating to the non-matching acoustic domain (that is mostly
   * much larger than the CFD domain. A typical spatial fade out function
   * "shrinks" the area of the source terms by a smooth function that is one
   * in large parts of the domain and reduces to zero at boundaries.
   *
   * If the source term is only used to blend in the source term over time
   * it has to be evaluated only once every time step. Therefore, we are using a
   * SpatialAwareFunction, which provides information if the function varies in
   * space for a given time.
